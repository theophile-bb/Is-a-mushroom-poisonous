# Is-a-mushroom-poisonous ?

Is a mushroom poisonous ? - Data Processing, Dimension Reduction, Classification 

Project led on a dataset referencing a wide panel of mushroom features (odor, color, habitat, number of
rings,...).

• Processing, cleaning and encoding of the data.

• Comparison of different dimension reduction techniques. Representation of the mushrooms as
embeddings on a 2D dimension using the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (T-SNE).

• Analysis of the results using segmentation methods (clustering) with all the features and the three
most correlated features with the poisonous characteristic.

• Study of the features importance in the classification process with a Decision tree. Deduction of
the minimum number of features required to obtain a perfect classification score.

• Comprehension and interpretation of the results of the classification with the decision tree and
confusion tables.
