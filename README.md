# Is a Mushroom Poisonous?
This project aims to predict whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible based on its physical characteristics using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview
Mushrooms exhibit a wide range of physical features, some of which can be indicative of their edibility. This project utilizes a dataset containing various attributes of mushrooms to train a machine learning model that can classify them as either poisonous or edible.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes 8,124 samples of mushrooms, each described by 22 categorical features such as cap shape, cap surface, cap color, bruises, odor, gill attachment, gill spacing, gill size, gill color, stalk shape, stalk root, stalk surface above ring, stalk surface below ring, stalk color above ring, stalk color below ring, veil type, veil color, ring number, ring type, spore print color, population, and habitat. The target variable indicates whether each mushroom is edible or poisonous.

## Methodology
The project follows these steps:

• Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

• Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the distribution of features and their correlation with the target variable.

• Model Selection and Training: Evaluating various machine learning algorithms to determine the best-performing model.

• Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using appropriate metrics and visualizations.
## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 95% on the test set, indicating a high level of performance in distinguishing between poisonous and edible mushrooms.
